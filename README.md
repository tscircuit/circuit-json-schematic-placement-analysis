# circuit-json-schematic-placement-analysis

Analyze `circuit-json` schematic placement and emit schematic placement issues
such as overlapping components, together with only the schematic box positions
that provide context for those issues.

The analysis also detects when vertically shifting one of two connected
components would align multiple opposing pin pairs and simplify their traces.

This is intended for placement-focused diagnostics. Multi-sheet results are
grouped by schematic sheet; circuits with zero or one sheet keep a compact flat
output. Each result contains issue nodes and, when useful,
`<SchematicBoxPlacement />` rows for the components involved in those issues.
Circuits without issues produce an empty string.

## Install

Install directly from GitHub codeload:

```sh
bun add https://codeload.github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json-schematic-placement-analysis/tar.gz/refs/heads/main
```

## Minimal Usage

```ts
import { analyzeSchematicPlacement } from "@tscircuit/circuit-json-schematic-placement-analysis"

const analysis = analyzeSchematicPlacement(circuitJson)

console.log(analysis.getLineItems())
console.log(analysis.toString())
```

## Sample Output

```xml
<SchematicBoxPositions>
  <SchematicBoxPlacement componentName="U1" positionAnchor="center" schX="0" schY="0" width="2.5" height="1.25" />
  <SchematicBoxPlacement componentName="R2" positionAnchor="center" schX="1" schY="0.5" width="1" height="0.5" />
</SchematicBoxPositions>
<SchematicPlacementIssues>
  <ComponentOverlap component1Name="U1" component2Name="R2" component1SchX="0" component1SchY="0" component2SchX="1" component2SchY="0.5" overlapWidth="0.25" overlapHeight="0.194">
    <OverlapCorrectionSuggestion target="R2" newSchX="1.25" deltaSchX="+0.25" />
    <OverlapCorrectionSuggestion target="R2" newSchY="0.694" deltaSchY="+0.194" />
  </ComponentOverlap>
</SchematicPlacementIssues>
```

## Text clearance and reset grouping

`SchematicTextClearanceSolver` checks independent annotations and generated
headings against wires, component bounds and other independent text. Component
reference/value labels, symbol text and trace-owned labels are excluded: their
owning objects must be moved instead. Issues identify the colliding objects and
suggest a text-anchor position when one is clear in the modeled geometry.
Text bounds approximate font size, anchors, rotation and line spacing; custom
symbol ink geometry is outside this check. Apply a suggestion and reanalyze.

`ResetNetworkGroupingSolver` recognizes a reset pin with one resistor to a known
supply and one capacitor to ground. It follows connectivity across labels and
respects separate sheets/groups and ambiguous hosts. The distance heuristic is
6 schematic units or three RC-symbol dimensions, measured from the reset pin.
A remote test point alone does not trigger a warning. The issue suggests grouping
the RC parts without changing connections or prescribing exact coordinates.

## Test

```sh
bun test
```

SVG snapshot tests use `bun-match-svg`, `circuit-to-svg`, and `stack-svgs`.
The fixture helper renders the schematic SVG on top and the analyzer output in
red text underneath so placement issues are easy to inspect visually.
